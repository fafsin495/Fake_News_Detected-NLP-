 ## Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing methods.
 
 There are 2 different studies in this repository. 
 
    **The first is my work using the LSTM neural network.** 
    
    **The second one consists of the works I have done using the Multinomial NaiveBayes and Logistic Regresion algorithms using TFIDF Vectorizer.**
